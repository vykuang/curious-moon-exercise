    "Named after a giant in greek myth, it first intrigued scientists for its high reflectivity, but was quickly dismissed as a \"dead iceball\" like its neighbouring moons. Voyager found that it was sitting in the middle of the diffuse and less dramatic E-ring, and hypotheses abound speculating its contribution to the ring. Was it volcanism? Why hasn't it drained out eons ago? Why is it so reflective even after so many inevitable impacts?\n",
    "\n",
    "E0-2 investigated the first strange phenomenon of Saturn's magnetic fields being *bent* by Enceladus. It also discovered that it spewed ice, creating a small atmosphere. Then the CIRS discovered a hot spot centered on the south pole, when it was expected to be the coldest. Readings of water and organic molecules were later registered. Even stranger - salt and silica were also found\n",

    "First hypothesis posited tidal pull from Saturn and Dione as the heat source, but stress zones measured did not match\n",
    "\n",
    "Enceladus is tidal locked to Saturn, rotating only once per *Saturn* year. This meant its face should be static relative to Saturn, except it was not. They also noted that changes in orbital distance changed plumes activity, presumably by varying the tidal stress; this indicated a flexible icy crust. Together this meant that the ice was completely detached from the core - Enceladus had a global ocean underneath.\n",
    "\n",
    "And still the question remained - where is the heat source to keep things liquid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Planetary science at the time had no working models to explain the global ocean and plume system, where it could peak 90 deg celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "If the core was porous, then water could seep in and become heated enough to drive the plumes\n",
