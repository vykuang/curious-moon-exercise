    "SARG is short for **search argument**. Sargable means that the database is able to perform an *index seek* to match the search predicate. If we're searching by an integer the engine could sort by that integer column, and automatically *seek* to that row without scanning every row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-sargable means that the database is not able to use index seek, i.e. it must perform some SQL function, e.g. `WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE 'CASSINI'`. The storage engine must return all rows to SQL engine for intermediate evaluation before searching. This becomes a sequential scan; all rows must be evaluated."
